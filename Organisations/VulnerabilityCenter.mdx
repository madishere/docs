Vulnerability Center
The Vulnerability Center enables organizations to get a comprehensive view of all the reports they received.

The Vulnerability Center has been designed to facilitate your report management. Thanks to this global view, you can:

    Quickly access reports by status or severity)

    Search for a specific report (by ID, Title, scope, endpoint, hunter username, CVE, and impact)

    Filter the data (period, BU & programs, status, severity, fix verification status, priority, assignment)

    Add additional filters for more precise queries (rewards, SLA, etc.)

vc_reports_1

The data displayed in the Vulnerability Center can also be exported in:

    CSV

    XLS

    JSON

    PDF

vc_reports_2

Last but no lest, the export feature includes an “Executive Report”.

This executive summary of the selected program(s) is a great way to communicate about the high level Bug Bounty metrics. The appendix also includes report details.

vc_reports_3

It is also possible to see the export history of a given program and retrieve previously generated exports (up to 7 days).
